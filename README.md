# Predicting the Sustainability of Accelerating Magnetic Gear Trains

This repo contains the code for my IB Extended Essay in Physics on predicting the stability of an accelerating magnetic gear train system. The full paper can be read [here](https://avandenbussche.github.io/attached/adam_vandenbussche_physics_ee.pdf).

This code analyzses the stability of the accelerating system and generates the graphs that are used in the paper. The data is hard-coded in `process_data.py`. Note that `scipy` version `0.19.1` is required.
